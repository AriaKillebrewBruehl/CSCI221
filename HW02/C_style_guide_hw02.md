### Style Guidelines

Here is a rough collection, perhaps not complete, of guidelines you should follow when writing your code:

* Use meaningful names. You should avoid single-letter names, only using them judiciously. (Exceptions might be `i`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `x0`, `a`, `A`, etc). 

* Use `camelCase` or `snake_case` for names.

* Indent structured code (roughly, as if you were writing Python) using curly braces around conditional and loop blocks.

* Only use constructs I've shown in class! (Don't avoid the puzzle.) See 
[my grammar for this homework](https://jimfix.github.io/csci221/assigns/C_grammar_hw02.html).

* Don't use `using namespace`. 

* Start using `std::endl` instead of `\n`.

* Put comments near or within tricky code. When using terse variable
names, comment how they are used if it is not obvious.

* Make a top comment in your source code with your name and the
assignment being solved.  Make a summary comment for each struct,
function, and procedure definition. See my 
[sample repo](https://github.com/ReedCS2-S20/Lec02-3-examples) 
for examples.
